# Layers of Love2d
This is a really quick game prototype I'm making with Love2d. A square bounces back and forth across a platform. The player must hit the spacebar to send the square up through a hole in the platform above. If the player makes it through, they move on to that next layer.

For information on installing and running Love2d on your system, refer to the [Love2d website](https://love2d.org/).

## Requirements
Download the following libraries and put them in a top level folder called "lib".
- bump: https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua
- hump: https://github.com/vrld/hump

## TODO
- Game over or reduce health if opening is missed
- Spawn powerups in holes periodically that:
  - Temporarily increase hole size
  - Temporarily reduce speed
  - Temporarily reduce player size
- Add sound effects
- Make the game prettier
- Style the HUD

## Contributions
This is supposed to be a simple portfolio piece for me, so I won't be accepting contributions for the time being. I'm open to it in the future, though!
