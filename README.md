# Layers of Love2d
This is a really quick game prototype I'm making with Love2d. A square bounces back and forth across a platform. The player must hit the spacebar to send the square up through a hole in the platform above. If the player makes it through, they move on to that next layer.

## Requirements
Download the following libraries and put them in a top level folder called "vendors".
- bump: https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua
- hump: https://github.com/vrld/hump

## TODO
- Game over if opening is missed
- Speed up player velocity slightly with each layer
- Reduce opening size slightly after a certain point
- Come up with a point system

## Contributions
This is supposed to be a simple portfolio piece for me, so I won't be accepting contributions for the time being. I'm open to it in the future, though!
